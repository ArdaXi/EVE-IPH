'
' How it works:
' VB.NET does not support control arrays as VB6 did with the index property.
' There is a way to get around this with minimal coding. 
' It requires a standard naming convention of the controls.
' Then the call to one function to search the screen based on that naming 
' convention to fill an array.
' 
' Example:
' To have a control array of 5 TextBoxes, you would have to name the textboxes 
' with the following convention:
'
' myTextBox0, myTextBox1, myTextBox2,myTextBox3, myTextBox4
' 
'Then in code, you would call: 
'dim myTextBoxArray as TextBox() = _
'    ControlArrayUtils.getControlArray(FORM, "myTextBox")
'
'The function will then search through all controls directly on the form that 
'match the name and have an integer value following it.
'Returning the new control array.
'
'ToDo: 
'     Add exception handling
'     Support recursive searching for controls within other controls.
