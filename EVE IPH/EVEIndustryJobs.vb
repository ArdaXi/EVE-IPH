    'Dim jobID As Long 'Unique ID for this job. Subject to the same renumbering as journal entries.
    'Dim assemblyLineID As Long 'ID of the assembly line this job is installed in. IDs for lines in stations don't change, but repackaged assembly arrays, repackaged mobile labs, and redeployed Rorquals will get new assemblyLineIDs.
    'Dim containerID As Long 'If the container is a station (see containerTypeID, below), this is the stationID in the staStations table. For a POS module, this is its itemID (see also the Corporation Asset List API page).
    'Dim installedItemID As Long 'Blueprint itemID. See asset list.
    'Dim installedItemLocationID As Long 'ID for the location from which the blueprint was installed. Office or POS module. See asset list.
    'Dim installedItemQuantity As Long 'Number of blueprints entered (so always 1)
    'Dim installedItemTimeEfficiency As Long 'Starting TE of blueprint.
    'Dim installedItemMaterialEfficiency As Long 'Starting ME of blueprint.
    'Dim installedItemLicensedProductionRunsRemaining As Long 'Starting number of runs remaining. (-1 for a BPO)
    'Dim outputLocationID As Long 'Destination hanger for product (built item when manufacturing, BPC when copying or inventing).
    'Dim installerID As Long 'ID of character who started this job.
    'Dim runs As Long 'Number of runs for this job (when making copies, number of BPCs to make).
    'Dim licensedProductionRuns As Long 'Number of runs on output BPCs for copying and inventing.
    'Dim installedInSolarSystemID As Long 'ID for the solar system this job was installed in. See mapSolarSystems table.
    'Dim containerLocationID As Long 'Container of the container. Seems to generally be the solar system ID.
    'Dim materialMultiplier As Double 'Modifier for amount of materials required over standard BPO/C listing, as effected by installation location (i.e. Rapid Assembly Arrays have a modifier of 1.2, resulting in 20% extra material usage)
    'Dim charMaterialMultiplier As Double 'Effect character's skills & implants have
    'Dim timeMultiplier As Double 'Effect of installation - ie, an advanced mobile lab as a timeMultiplier of 0.65 when copying.
    'Dim charTimeMultiplier As Double 'Speed of research/invention/production, as reduced by individual character skills.
    'Dim installedItemTypeID As Long 'TypeID of blueprint. See tables INVENTORY_TYPES and invBlueprintTypes|invBlueprintTypes.
    'Dim outputTypeID As Long 'TypeID of product. This refers to what's been built, what's being copied, or what's being invented. See INVENTORY_TYPES table.
    'Dim containerTypeID As Long 'TypeID of container, such as station, mobile lab, or assembly array. Again, see INVENTORY_TYPES table.
    'Dim installedItemCopy As Long '0 if the blueprint is an original, 1 if it is a copy.
    'Dim completed As Long '1 if the job has been delivered, 0 if not.
    'Dim completedSuccessfully As Long 'Always 0?
    'Dim installedItemFlag As Long 'See APIv2 Inventory Flags?
    'Dim outputFlag As Long 'See APIv2 Inventory Flags?
    'Dim activityID As Long 'Activity ID of this job. See TL2MaterialsActivity.
    'Dim completedStatus As Long 'See Invention/completedStatus below.
    'Dim installTime As Date 'When this job was installed.
    'Dim beginProductionTime As Date 'When this job was started (after waiting in line or rounding to the next minute, for example).
    'Dim endProductionTime As Date 'When this job will finish or was finished. (Not when it was delivered.)
    'Dim pauseProductionTime As Date 'Normally "0001-01-01 00:00:00". If the job was installed into a POS module and that module went offline, this is when that module went offline. The S&I window in-game calculates the difference between this and endProductionTime to show time remaining (in red, and not counting down). When the module is back up, this is reset to "0001-01-01 00:00:00" and the endProductionTime is updated to reflect the delay.
